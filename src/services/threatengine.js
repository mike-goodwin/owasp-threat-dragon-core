The software uses external input toconstruct a pathname that is intended to identify a fileor directory that is located underneath a restrictedparent directory, but the software does not properlyneutralize special elements within the pathname thatcan cause the pathname to resolve to a location that isoutside of the restricted directory. By using specialelements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackerscan escape outside of the restricted location to accessfiles or directories that are elsewhere on the system.One of the most common special elements is the\"../\" sequence, which in most modern operatingsystems is interpreted as the parent directory of thecurrent location. This is referred to as relative pathtraversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolutepathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may alsobe useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referredto as absolute path traversal.[101]',

Use an\"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e.,use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictlyconform to specifications. Reject any input that doesnot strictly conform to specifications or transform itinto something that does. When performing inputvalidation, consider all potentially relevant properties,including length, type of input, the full range ofacceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax,consistency across related fields, and conformance tobusiness rules. As an example of business rule logic,\"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it onlycontains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid ifthe input is only expected to contain colors such as\"red\" or \"blue.\" Do not rely exclusively on lookingfor malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on ablacklist). A blacklist is likely to miss at least oneundesirable input, especially if the code\'senvironment changes. This can give attackers enoughroom to bypass the intended validation. However,blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacksor determining which inputs are so malformed thatthey should be rejected outright.Use a vetted library or framework that does not allowthis weakness to occur or provides constructs thatmake this weakness easier to avoid.Use an application firewall that can detect attacksagainst this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases inwhich the code cannot be fixed (because it iscontrolled by a third party), as an emergencyprevention measure while more comprehensivesoftware assurance measures are applied, or toprovide defense in depth.Run your code using the lowest privileges that arerequired to accomplish the necessary tasks. If possible,create isolated accounts with limited privileges thatare only used for a single task. That way, a successfulattack will not immediately give the attacker access tothe rest of the software or its environment. Forexample, database applications rarely need to run asthe database administrator, especially in day-to-dayoperations.Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandboxenvironment that enforces strict boundaries betweenthe process and the operating system. This mayeffectively restrict which files can be accessed in adirectory or which command can be executed by thesoftware. OS-level examples include the Unix chrootjail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed codemay provide some protection. For example,java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManagerallows the software to specify restrictions on fileoperations.Attack Surface Reduction: Store library, include, andutility files outside of the web document root, ifpossible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directoryand use the web server\'s access control capabilities toprevent attackers from directly requesting them. Onecommon practice is to define a fixed constant in eachcalling program, then check for the existence of theconstant in the library/include file; if the constant doesnot exist, then the file was directly requested, and itcan exit immediately. This significantly reduces thechance of an attacker being able to bypass anyprotection mechanisms that are in the base programbut not in the include files. It will also reduce theattack surface.Ensure that error messages only contain minimaldetails that are useful to the intended audience, andnobody else. The messages need to strike the balancebetween being too cryptic and not being crypticenough. They should not necessarily reveal themethods that were used to determine the error. Suchdetailed information can be used to refine the originalattack to increase the chances of success. In thecontext of path traversal, error messages whichdisclose path information can help attackers craft theappropriate attack strings to move through the filesystem hierarchy.[8]3.

Threat agents might exploitvulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data while it\'straveling across the wire.

Avoid mixed SSLsessions as they may expose the user\'s session ID.Use strong, industry standard cipher suites withappropriate key lengths.Use certificates signed by a trusted CA provider.Never allow self-signed certificates and considercertificate pinning for security consciousapplications.Always require SSL chain verification.Only establish a secure connection after verifyingthe identity of the endpoint server using trustedcertificates in the key chain.Alert users through the UI if the mobile app detectsan invalid certificate.Do not send sensitive data over alternate channels(e.g, SMS, MMS, or notifications).If possible, apply a separate layer of encryption toany sensitive data before it is given to the SSLchannel. In the event that future vulnerabilities arediscovered in the SSL implementation, theencrypted data will provide a secondary defenseagainst confidentiality violation.iOS Specific Best Practices:Default classes in the latest version of iOS handleSSL cipher strength negotiation very well. Troublecomes when developers temporarily add code tobypass these defaults to accommodatedevelopment hurdles. In addition to the abovegeneral practices:Ensure that certificates are valid and fail closed.When using CFNetwork, consider using the SecureTransport API to designate trusted clientcertificates. In almost all situations,NSStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1 should be usedfor higher standard cipher strength.After development, ensure all NSURL calls (orwrappers of NSURL) do not allow self-signed orinvalid certificates such as the NSURL class methodsetAllowsAnyHTTPSCertificate.Consider using certificate pinning by doing thefollowing: export your certificate, include it in yourapp bundle, and anchor it to your trust object.Using the NSURL methodconnection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: will now accept your cert.Android Specific Best Practices:Remove all code after the development cycle thatmay allow the application to accept all certificatessuch asorg.apache.http.conn.ssl.AllowAllHostnameVerifierorSSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER. These are equivalent to trusting all certificates.If using a class which extends SSLSocketFactory,make sure checkServerTrusted method is properlyimplemented so that server certificate is correctlychecked.[51]6.
