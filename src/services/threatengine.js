Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) approximate randomness algorithmically, starting with a seed from which subsequent values are calculated.There are two types of PRNGs: statistical and cryptographic. Statistical PRNGs provide useful statistical properties, but their output is highly predictable and forms an easy to reproduce numeric stream that is unsuitable for use in cases where security depends on generated values being unpredictable. Cryptographic PRNGs address this problem by generating output that is more difficult to predict. For a value to be cryptographically secure, it must be impossible or highly improbable for an attacker to distinguish between it and a truly random value.

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory. By using special elements such as \"..\" and \"/\" separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system. One of the most common special elements is the \"../\" sequence, which in most modern operating systems is interpreted as the parent directory of the current location. This is referred to as relative path traversal. Path traversal also covers the use of absolute pathnames such as \"/usr/local/bin\", which may also be useful in accessing unexpected files. This is referred to as absolute path traversal.[8]',
                    mitigation:'Input Validation: Assume all input is malicious.  Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i. e. , use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications.  Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications or transform it into something that does.  When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules.  As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue. \" Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i. e. , do not rely on a blacklist).  A blacklist is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code\\s environment changes.  This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation.  However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid. Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness.  It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth. Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks.  If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task.  That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment.  For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations. Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system.  This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a directory or which command can be executed by the software.  OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux.  In general, managed code may provide some protection.  For example, java. io. FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations. Attack Surface Reduction: Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible.  Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server\\s access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them.  One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.  This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files.  It will also reduce the attack surface. Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience, and nobody else.  The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic and not being cryptic enough.  They should not necessarily reveal the methods that were used to determine the error.  Such detailed information can be used to refine the original attack to increase the chances of success.  In the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy. [8]'});});

Trouble comes when developers temporarily add code to bypass these defaults to accommodate development hurdles.  In addition to the above general practices:Ensure that certificates are valid and fail closed. When using CFNetwork, consider using the Secure Transport API to designate trusted client certificates.  In almost all situations, NSStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1 should be used for higher standard cipher strength. After development, ensure all NSURL calls (or wrappers of NSURL) do not allow self-signed or invalid certificates such as the NSURL class method setAllowsAnyHTTPSCertificate. Consider using certificate pinning by doing the following: export your certificate, include it in your app bundle, and anchor it to your trust object.  Using the NSURL method connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: will now accept your cert. Android Specific Best Practices:Remove all code after the development cycle that may allow the application to accept all certificates such as org. apache. http. conn. ssl. AllowAllHostnameVerifier or SSLSocketFactory. ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER.  These are equivalent to trusting all certificates.

Timeout periods vary accordingly based on the application, but some good guidelines are: 15 minutes for high security apps, 30 minutes for medium security apps, and 1 hour for low security apps. Properly reset cookies during authentication state changes, by destroying sessions on the server side and making sure that the cookies presented as a part of the previous sessions are no longer acceptedIn addition to properly invalidating tokens on the server side during key application events, make sure tokens are generated properly by using well-established and industry standard methods of creating tokens.
